# Record On Calendar

An overcomplicated, but pretty smart program to record audio automatically according to iCal calendar events.
Fully configurable.

_Using SoX and LAME (downloads runtimes automatically)._

Example config:

```yaml
# █▀█ █▀▀ █▀▀ █▀█ █▄░█ █▀▀ ▄▀█ █░░
# █▀▄ ██▄ █▄▄ █▄█ █░▀█ █▄▄ █▀█ █▄▄

# Config file generated by Record on Calendar
version: 2.0.0 # Don't change this!

# Config file format is YAML. The RecOnCal will try to migrate it to new versions if updated.
# Made by Benedek Fodor in 2022
