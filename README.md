# Record On Calendar

An overcomplicated, but pretty smart program to record multitrack audio automatically according to iCal calendar events.
Fully configurable. (Currently only supports 128 kbps mp3 recording, this can be easily expanded if needed - drop an issue)

_Using FFMPEG / DirectShow (downloads runtime automatically)._

### Example config:

```yaml
# █▀█ █▀▀ █▀▀ █▀█ █▄░█ █▀▀ ▄▀█ █░░
# █▀▄ ██▄ █▄▄ █▄█ █░▀█ █▄▄ █▀█ █▄▄

# Config file generated by Record on Calendar
version: 3.0.0 # Don't change this!

# Config file format is YAML. The RecOnCal will try to migrate it to new versions if updated.
# Made by Benedek Fodor in 2022

### Example audio setup:
```yaml
# DEVICES - TRACKS

# These are the audio devices the program detected in your computer.
# Please select which ones you want to record.
# If you remove an enabled device from the system, it does not get removed from here.
# New devices get added at the top.

# EXAMPLE:

# Example Microphone 1:   # Human readable name of the input (this shows up in your OS; don't change)
#   filename: John Guitar # You can specify a filename for this track. Leave on '~' to use the name of the device as track name.
#   record: true          # Set to true to record
#   id: 'xxxxxxxxxxxx'    # Used internally, don't change

Microphone (Realtek(R) Audio):
  fileName: ~
  record: false
  id: '@device_cm_{xxxxxx}\wave_{xxxxxx}'
```
