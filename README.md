# Record On Calendar

An overcomplicated, but pretty smart program to record multitrack audio automatically according to Google Calendar events.
Fully configurable.

_Using FFMPEG / DirectShow (downloads runtime automatically)._

### Example config:

```yaml
# █▀█ █▀▀ █▀▀ █▀█ █▄░█ █▀▀ ▄▀█ █░░
# █▀▄ ██▄ █▄▄ █▄█ █░▀█ █▄▄ █▀█ █▄▄

# Config file generated by Record on Calendar
version: 4.2.0 # Don't change this!

# Config file format is YAML. The RecOnCal will try to migrate it to new versions if updated.
# Made by Benedek Fodor (RedyAu) in 2022-2024

debug: false # Set to true to see additional messages on console.

### Example audio setup:
```yaml
# DEVICES - TRACKS

# These are the audio devices the program detected in your computer.
# Please select which ones you want to record.
# If you remove an enabled device from the system, it does not get removed from here.
# New devices get added at the top.

# EXAMPLE:

# Example Microphone 1:   # Human readable name of the input (this shows up in your OS; don't change)
#   filename: John Guitar # You can specify a filename for this track. Leave on '~' to use the name of the device as track name.
#   record: true          # Set to true to record

LGPLite Stream Engine:
  fileName: ~
  record: false
```
